IDEAS

THEME: YOUR LIFE IS CURRENCY

// Su elu on valuuta
	// elu - 



* You are a cat with nine lives and must carefully choose how to spend your lives to get through a puzzle/platformer

// Idea already taken ...
	
	* Every level or for the game you get 9 lives
	* 9 lives for 8 levels, every level you must buy one toy/make one sacrifice.
		* Toys will stay on you for all levels or you can only use a toy once,
		  but if you buy a wrong toy you can't make it and have to restart the game/level
	* Every level has challenges
		* Must die to get to the other side ...
			* Must cross the road
		* Must invest in powerups to solve levels	
			* Better vision to see the finish
			* Buy a ball of yarn to improve agility/speed and make a jump otherwise impossible
			* Buy a mouse toy for better attack
			* Buy a climbing post to be able to climb
			* Catnip - 
			* Laser toy - improve tracking/sight? 


* Doctor that spends his own life to fix/save people during the month and gets paid in new lives after the month ends.
* Same thing with blood donations

//Scope, features get complicated fast

	* If you kill yourself before payday - game over
	* Can't let people die
	* Can choose which people to help
		* Math based puzzle element where for example out of the 1 life you have at the begginig you can help people who have
			* 0.7
			* 0.4
			* 0.1
		needs and you need to help 0.7 and 0.1 otherwise you die. Then you have 0.2 left at the end of the month.


* Investment banker/stock trader who invests in lives to make himself immortal

// No good gameplay, largely text based
// Hard to figure out how to earn lives that could be traded

	* You start with X lives - why? - you borrow them from from mobs and have to pay it back with high interests.
	* You invest your lives into other people for returns
		* For example you invest 2 lives in an overdosing drug addict
			* He overdoses again and almost dies
			* Second time around he gets himself together and becomes a very successful someone who gets multiple lives...


* Vigilante that takes the lives of bad people and gives life to good people


* You need to always put some of your health aside to save for the future
