This repository hosts the game I created for my Ludum Dare 44 submission

9 Lives

9 Lives is platformer where a kitty must spend some of its precious 9 lives to advance to next levels. You can buy toys to improve your jumping ability and speed or give you skills like being able to climb obstacles or smack objects. 

How to play is embedded to the game. 

This is my first game I have created from scratch on my own. Pretty happy how it turned out! 

Created by Martin Laidma for Ludum Dare 44

Developed in Unity
Graphics are handrawn, scanned and retouched in Photoshop
Music and SFX created with vocals, Audacity,
https://midi.city/ and https://www.tones.fm/.

Thanks for playing! :)
