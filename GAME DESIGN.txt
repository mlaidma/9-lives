* You are a cat with nine lives and must carefully choose how to spend your lives to get through a puzzle/platformer

// Idea already taken ...
	
	* Every level or for the game you get 9 lives
	* 9 lives for 8 levels, every level you must buy one toy/make one sacrifice.
		* Toys will stay on you for all levels or you can only use a toy once,
		  but if you buy a wrong toy you can't make it and have to restart the game/level
	* Every level has challenges
		* Must die to get to the other side ...
			* Must cross the road
		* Must invest in powerups to solve levels	
			* Better vision to see the finish
			* Buy a ball of yarn to improve agility/speed and make a jump otherwise impossible
			* Buy a mouse toy for better attack
			* Buy a climbing post to be able to climb
			* Catnip - 
			* Laser toy - improve tracking/sight?
